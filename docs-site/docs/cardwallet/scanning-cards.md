# Scanning Cards

OSS CardWallet makes it easy to digitize your physical cards by scanning their barcodes.

![Capture Screen](/img/screenshots/cardwallet/1_en-US.png)


## Using the Camera

1. Tap the **+** button to add a new card
2. Select **Add From Camera**

### Barcode

Barcodes will be directly detected with the card itself

### Auto Capture

The default capture mode uses intelligent edge detection to automatically capture documents when:

- The document is properly positioned within the viewfinder
- All four edges are detected
- The image is stable (no motion blur)

**How to enable Auto Capture:**

The first time you open the capture screen you'll be prompted to enable or disable Auto Capture.
After that you can enable or disable it by long pressing the capture button

**How to use Auto Capture:**

1. Hold your device steady above the document
2. Wait for the green frame to appear around the document edges
3. The app will automatically capture when conditions are optimal

### Manual Capture

For situations where auto-capture doesn't work well (glossy surfaces, low contrast) you can simply use the capture button

## Batch Scanning

Batch scanning allows you to scan multiple pages into a single document:

1. Enable batch scanning with the button left of the capture button
2. Start capturing pages as normal
3. Each captured page is added to the current batch
4. Review all pages in the batch preview
5. Tap **Done** when finished to create the document

## Auto Edge Detection

The app uses advanced computer vision (OpenCV) to detect document edges:

### How It Works

1. The camera feed is analyzed in real-time
2. Contours are detected in the image
3. Quadrilateral shapes are identified as potential documents
4. The largest valid quadrilateral is selected as the document boundary

### Tips for Better Detection

- **Good lighting**: Ensure even lighting without harsh shadows
- **Contrast**: Place documents on contrasting backgrounds
- **Flat surface**: Keep documents flat to avoid warped edges
- **Clean lens**: Wipe your camera lens for clear captures

### Manual Adjustment

If auto-detection doesn't perfectly identify edges:

1. After capture, the edge adjustment screen appears
2. Drag the corner handles to adjust the document boundaries
3. Drag edge midpoints for fine adjustments
4. Tap **Done** to apply the selection

## Camera Settings

Access camera settings by tapping the **gear icon** in the capture view:

### Resolution (android)

On android you can select the camera resolution based on your needs.

### Flash Control

- **Auto**: Flash fires when needed in low light
- **On**: Flash always fires
- **Off**: Flash disabled

### Torch mode

You can use this to enable torch mode instead of Flash Control

### Focus Mode

- **Auto Focus**: Tap to focus on specific areas
- **Continuous**: Camera continuously adjusts focus

## Transformations

There you can select default brightness, contrast, fitlers... to apply to scanned documents

### Document edges not detected

- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Use a contrasting background
- Try manual capture mode
- Clean your camera lens

### Blurry captures

- Hold the device steady
- Wait for auto-focus to complete
- Ensure adequate lighting
- Try manual focus by tapping the screen

### Auto-capture too sensitive/slow

- Adjust auto-capture sensitivity in settings
- Switch to manual capture for difficult documents

## Manual Entry

If scanning doesn't work, you can enter barcode data manually:

1. Tap the **+** button
2. Select **Create**
3. Choose the barcode format
4. Enter the barcode number
5. Add card details and save
