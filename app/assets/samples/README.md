## PKPass Files

### sample-loyalty-card.pkpass

A sample Apple Wallet pass file (PKPass) for testing the PKPass import and rendering functionality.

**Contents:**
- Pass Type: Store Card (Loyalty Card)
- Organization: Sample Store
- Balance: $50.00
- Member: John Doe
- Member Since: 2024
- Tier: Gold
- Barcode: QR Code with message "123456789"

This is a minimal valid PKPass file structure for development and testing purposes.

## Using Sample Files

To test PKPass import:
1. Copy the .pkpass file to a device
2. Use the app's import functionality to import the pass
3. Verify that the pass displays correctly in the card view

Note: The images in this sample pass are minimal placeholders. Real PKPass files would contain proper brand images, logos, and graphics.
